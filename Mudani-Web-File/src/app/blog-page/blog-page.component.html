                    <h3>What is diversification & why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>It’s a strategy that involves splitting up your investment portfolio into different types of assets that behave differently.</p>
                    <p>Diversification is one of those finance buzzwords that people use and don’t
                        actually explain. Maybe you read that diversification is good for your portfolio — and maybe you even know that it’s because it reduces risk. But why? And how?</p>

                <aside>
                    <h3>Here's the breakdown:</h3>
                    <p>It’s basically not putting all your financial eggs in one basket. It means building an investment portfolio that’s made up of many <span class="blueInColor"> different types of investments</span> that behave in different ways.</p>
                    <p>You can diversify across assets classes so you own both stocks and bonds — and maybe even some alternatives/crypto. And within those assets, you can diversify even further. For example, you can own stocks in large companies, small companies, tech companies, US companies, foreign companies... you get it. </p>

                    <h3>How to create a diversified portfolio?</h3>
                    <p>A diversified portfolio is kind of like a nutritious diet. To stay healthy, your body needs a variety of nutrients from proteins, veggies, and fruits to carbs. And within those foods groups, each provide different vitamins. Avocados are full of vitamin A (which explains the $15 toast), while broccoli is good source of fiber, protein and iron. The more varied your diet, the more nutrients you’ll be exposed to — a similar concept to investing. Having a diversified portfolio is how your money stays healthy. I know carbs are the best but if that’s all we ate, we would probably crash and burn. Remember when you were little and your mom would say, “everything in moderation” – that still applies. Treat your money like your body and fill it with all different nutritious ingredients to grow big and strong (i.e. stocks, bonds, alternatives – even crypto). As John Mayer says, your body is a wonderland – so is your money.</p>
                    <p>The key to diversification is to choose investments that aren’t highly correlated to one another. Correlation is another finance buzzword, which measures how the prices of different assets move together – basically their relationship. If the prices move in the same direction, they have high correlation. If the prices move in a different direction, they have low correlation (meaning the things that affect one investment, doesn’t affect the other at the same time). For example, stocks and bonds often (but not always) move in opposite directions — as stocks go up, bonds go down and vice versa. Understanding the correlation of different assets is important in managing the level of risk in a portfolio – if assets aren’t highly <span class="blueInColor"> correlated</span>  with each other, the risk is lower.</p>

                    <h3>What’s the risk?</h3>
                    <p>Diversification isn’t a cure-all or guarantee – similar to how a balanced diet won’t protect you from ever getting sick. There will always be certain risks like global recession, regulatory or outlier scenarios like the Covid-19 pandemic, which could definitely affect your investments. But the more diverse your investments are, the better they are able to help you mitigate risk. And a strategy to help reduce risk in a diversified portfolio is a method called rebalancing.</p>

                <aside>
                    <h3>What is rebalancing?</h3>
                    <p>Buzz buzz, another word – rebalancing: is the strategy of adjusting your asset allocation to make sure it remains consistent with your goals. When you create a diversified portfolio, you choose a certain asset allocation (% of different investments) based on your risk tolerance, goals, and timeline. At <span class="blueInColor">Mudani</span> , diversification is at the center of our investment approach. And when you invest with us, we take care of how to diversify your investment portfolio for you, based on your personalized situation. Your customized plan will include low-cost ETFs and/or funds that include stocks, bonds, options, and alternatives – all carefully chosen based on your profile. Then we automatically make adjustments – rebalance – when your investments move away from your target asset allocation (which happens, since the value of the investments in your portfolio will move up and down). You may ask, how often does this happen? Constantly. It’s not a one-time task. Over the long term, stocks generally rise faster than bonds, so the stock portion will likely increase relative to the bond portion in your portfolio – except when you rebalance to maintain your original target.</p>

                    <h3>Story Time</h3>
                    <p>Logan and Jared are twins and both started investing at the same time. Based on their risk tolerance, goals and time horizon they each decided to open a diversified investment portfolio consisting of 70% stocks and 30% bonds – but Logan’s portfolio will automatically rebalance to maintain the 70/30 asset allocation and Jared’s will not. Now what? As the market moves (aka volatility) – stocks are rising faster than bonds – shifting Logan and Jared’s portfolio to 85% stocks and 15% bonds. However – with the automatic adjustment – Logan is rebalanced back to his original asset allocation (risk profile) of 70% stocks and 30% bonds and now Jared’s risk exposure has risen by 15% – not his original plan. Rebalancing can help you build and maintain a portfolio that’s right for your <span class="blueInColor">risk tolerance.</span> </p>

                    <h3>Benefits of diversification</h3>
                    <p>Diversification involves owning assets that are not closely connected or affected by the market in the same way. In your portfolio, diversification reduces market volatility, investment risk, and provides the ingredients for a balanced diet – in finance we call that a free lunch.</p>
